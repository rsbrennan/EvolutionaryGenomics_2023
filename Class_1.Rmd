# Study system we'll be focusing on

Our study system will be the killifish, [Fundulus heteroclitus](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/mrri/acechar/speciesgallery/Fish/Mummichog/index.html#:~:text=Mummichogs%2C%20locally%20called%20mud%20minnows,and%20other%20shallow%20coastal%20habitats.) (also called mummichog or mud minnow). 

This species is the best for lots of reasons. They're broadly distributed along the east coast of North America, from Florida into Canada. ADDMAP from fishbase/aquamaps.

They're the most abundant vertebrate in the habitats where tye live and, given their broad range, they're super tolerant of lots of conditions: broad temperatures, salinity, hypoxia, among others. They also don't move much, with an adult typically staying in the marsh where it is born and not moving more than a few hundred meters over its life. 

<div class="text-box">

Given the high population sizes and low migration, what might we predict about populations of killifish from different regions of their distribution?

## study system

We're going to work with data from a 2018 paper in Global Change Biology, led by Tim Healy [link to paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14386). I encourage you NOT to look at the publication, as we're going to go through a bunch of these results together for this tutorial. 

We sampled fish from across the range of the eastern United States, about 30 fish per site. Below is a map of the sampling locations. We knew about their population structure ahead of time, so if you're thinking the sampling looks funny, it will become clear as we analyze the data together.

map, subspecies, general ecology.

phenotypic differences
- temperature
- hypoxia

ToDo- gather together the phenotype data.
